 * Arithmetic expression evaluation. Evaluate.java is a stack client that evaluates fully
 * parenthesized arithmetic expressions. It uses Dijkstra's 2-stack algorithm:
 *
 *     Push operands onto the operand stack.
 *     Push operators onto the operator stack.
 *     Ignore left parentheses.
 *     On encountering a right parenthesis, pop an operator,
 *     pop the requisite number of operands, and push onto the operand stack
 *     the result of applying that operator to those operands.
 *
 * This code is a simple example of an interpreter.
